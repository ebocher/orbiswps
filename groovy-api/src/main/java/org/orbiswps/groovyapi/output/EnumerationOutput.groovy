/**
 * Enumeration output annotation.

 *
 *  - keywords : String[]
 *      Array of keywords that characterize a process, its inputs, and outputs. Normally available for display to a
 *      human. It is composed of a succession of two String : the human readable keyword list coma

 *      i.e. keywords = ["the keyword 1,the keyword 2", "en",
 *                       "le mot clef 1, le mot clef 2", "fr"]
 *  - identifier : String
 *      Unambiguous identifier of a process, input, and output. It should be a valid URI.
 *
 *  - metadata : String[]
 *      Reference to additional metadata about this item. It is composed of a succession of three String : the metadata
 *      role, the metadata title and the href, coma separated.
 *      i.e. metadata = ["role1,title,href1",
 *                       "role2,title,href2"]
 *
 *  - multiSelection : boolean
 *      Allow or not to select more than one value.
